### Subject: Revolutionizing Industrial Operations with OpsTwin

I'm excited to verify the MVP of **OpsTwin**, an open-source platform designed to bridge the gap between static monitoring and dynamic, AI-driven action.

**OpsTwin** allows external AI agents to seamlessly interact with industrial digital twins using the **AIW (AI Web) Protocol**. It goes beyond simple monitoring by integrating:

🔹 **Real-time Telemetry**: Ingest and analyze sensor data instantly with TimescaleDB & Redis.
🔹 **Hybrid Simulation**: Run Monte Carlo & Quantum simulations (Qiskit) for precise "What-if" analysis before execution.
🔹 **Policy Engine**: RBAC and confidence-based automated execution ensures safety.

Whether you're in Smart Manufacturing, Energy, or IT Infrastructure, OpsTwin provides the backbone for autonomous operations.

### Title: [Project] OpsTwin: An AI-First Digital Twin Platform with Quantum Simulation Integration

Hey everyone,

I've been working on **OpsTwin**, a platform that rethinks how AI agents interact with operational systems. Instead of building custom connectors for every tool, OpsTwin exposes a **Digital Twin** via the **AIW Protocol** (Manifest + Schema + Diff/Stream).

**Key Tech Stack:**

* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Redis, TimescaleDB, MQTT
* **Simulation**: Hybrid Classical (Monte Carlo) + Quantum (Qiskit)
* **Protocol**: AIW (JSON Schema, SSE, Delta Sync)

We're trying to solve the "Human-in-the-loop" latency problem by giving AI agents a standardized way to perceive state, run simulations, and propose actions based on strict policies.

The MVP includes a full Docker compose setup to get started in 5 minutes. Would love your feedback on the architecture!

### OpsTwin: The Playground for Industrial AI Agents

OpsTwin provides a **gym-like environment** for your AI agents but for real-world industrial operations. Training an agent to manage a factory or optimize a server cluster? Use OpsTwin to simulate, validate, and execute.

* **Standardized Interface**: interacts via **AIW Protocol** (Manifest/Schema).
* **Simulation Environment**: Built-in Monte Carlo & Quantum sim engines for reward calculation.
* **Safe Execution**: Policy engine ensures your agent doesn't break production environments.
